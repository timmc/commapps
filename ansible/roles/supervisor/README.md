# Supervisor

The supervisor is a host that is given power over the other hosts and
has the responsibility of monitoring and maintaining them.

To reduce the risk of compromise of this privileged host, it should
only run software necessary to carry out these tasks. Additionally, it
should not accept network traffic in general or be directly accessible
from the internet.
