# The ZFS tooling has the irritating property that when a pool exists,
# it only shows up under `zpool import` when it is exported, and only
# shows up under `zpool list` when it is imported. There doesn't seem
# to be a command that will show it in both states.

# If the mountpoint is ever changed, it will need to be modified on
# existing hosts' commdata pools. It can only be checked after import,
# so it's irritating to do from Ansible, but here's the command:
