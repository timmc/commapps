# Note that this file lists *all possible* services that might be
# storing data in this partition. Systemd will ignore the ones that
# aren't installed.
#
# Including just the relevant and installed services is non-trivial in
# Ansible, since when it checks or regenerates the file, it won't
# necessarily know which lines are needed -- there's not enough
# context, especially if I run just subsets of playbooks, or the order
# changes.
#
# An alternative, if this stops being workable or palatable, would be
# to use a systemd-generator and call `systemctl daemon-reload` to
# regenerate the unit file from a collection of fragments in a
# directory (still kind of order-dependent). Or, could use a custom
# generator called by ansible (if the systemd native approach doesn't
# work.)
#
# Finally, we could switch to overwriting the nginx, sandstorm,
# prosody, etc. service files to include a *forward* dependency
# on commdata instead of a list of reverse dependencies here. This
# would probably have to be a last resort.
